# Environmental Data Analysis

This notebook analyzes environmental data collected by the agro rover across the field. We'll import necessary libraries and load the cleaned sensor data for comprehensive analysis.


## Time Series Analysis

### Individual Metric Trends Over Time

Create a comprehensive time series plot showing how each environmental metric changes over time. We'll display both raw data points and smoothed trend lines using Savitzky-Golay filtering to better visualize patterns and trends.

### Normalized Metrics Comparison

Normalize all environmental metrics to a 0-1 scale and plot them together. This allows us to compare the relative changes of different metrics on the same scale and identify correlations between various environmental parameters.

## Spatial Analysis

### Geographic Distribution of Environmental Metrics

Visualize how each environmental metric varies across the field using scatter plots. Each point represents a measurement location with color-coded values showing the spatial distribution and helping identify areas with similar characteristics or potential hotspots.

## Statistical Analysis

### Correlation Between Environmental Metrics

Generate a correlation heatmap to understand the statistical relationships between different environmental parameters. This helps identify which factors are interconnected and may influence each other in the agricultural system.

### Spatial Interpolation Heatmaps

Create continuous spatial heatmaps using interpolation to show smooth distributions of each environmental metric across the field. This provides a comprehensive view of spatial patterns and gradients that can guide precision agriculture decisions.

## Additional Data Exploration

### Coordinate Data Analysis

Load and examine the coordinate data to understand the spatial coverage and sampling pattern of the agro rover's data collection across the field.

## Sample Field Images

Display sample images captured by the agro rover during its field survey to provide visual context for the environmental data analysis.
